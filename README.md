our urban fruit tree project 
(by joseph herbert; not to be confused with the @portland fruit tree project)

## solutions - multiparts: ##
1. catchers
2. bins
3. signs (IRL physical)
4. tech/apps (virtual)
5. distribution? (optional?unsure)

---
### solution descriptions: ###
EACH SOLUTION PIECE IS MODULAR:
WHILE COMPLEMENTARY, THEY CAN STAND INDEPENDENTLY.

1. cloth or other material
a.
 hung from branches, trunk (diagonal?)
'catches' fruit as it falls from the tree
b.
 prefer: 'deposits' or 'slides' fruit (angled slope) into specific part of ground.
(mitigates or eliminates need to manually remove from catchers)


2. collection bins
stands or sits underneath or next to tree
fruit is collected & kept in bins
(with #1, automatically; or without #1, then manually) 


3. signs (physical)
a la community notice boards
standing up on pedestal/podium
printed paper vs engraved?

FREE [ORGANIC*] [HYPERLOCAL ;P] FRUIT

## poss. benefits ##

.2. benefit (test if accurate):
improves fruit attractiveness => likelihood of fruit being taken, consumed by passerby
eases/simplifies, accelerates redistribution

poss risk:
increased risk of molding/rotting/insects (by consolidating into all-same-place, touching)
increased bruising if dropped in (vs onto potentially softer ground)
=> poss: use softer basket for collection (instead of plastic bin)
==> poss benefit: improves attractiveness
==> poss risk: increases cost; may decrease attractiveness as wear/tear(?vs plastic?); may be harder to clean (and keep clean)




## general poss. risks/costs/challenges: ##
[incomplete; more to fill in later]





## problems solved: ##
* sidewalks, streets, driveways not littered w/ messy fruit anymore

* resilence/emergency prep/sustainability
(we'll have a food supply much of the year,
when (not if) the 9.2mag cascadia quake hits)

* food going to waste
** ghg/pollut (from rotting fruit)
** toxic (pesticde) alternatives consumed (from storebought apples, fruit)

** unneccessary cost (grocery dollars) spent
** some people hungry/malnutr due to lack of access

value added:
* free food - lowers grocery costs
* invites more walkability in nghbhd's
* sense of connected place / community
